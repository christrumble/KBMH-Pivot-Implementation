### 8. GO-LIVE STRATEGY

#### 8.1 What is the go-live approach and transition strategy?

**Answer:**

**Go-Live Strategy: Soft Cutover (NOT Hard Cutover)**

**Soft Cutover Approach:**
- **Start new business in NetSuite on go-live date**
- **Run existing projects in Core until completion**
- **Typical dual-system period: ~6 months**
- **Phased project migration where possible**

**Rationale for Soft Cutover:**
- Reduces risk of disrupting in-flight projects
- Allows team to focus on learning NetSuite with new work
- Prevents need to migrate complex active projects mid-stream
- Natural transition as Core projects complete

**Support During Go-Live:**
- Go-live checklist provided
- On-site support option available
- Alternative: Microsoft Teams channel support
- Post go-live support included (30 days)

**User Stories:**
- As a Project Manager, I need to complete my in-flight projects in Core so that I'm not learning a new system mid-project
- As a Sales Rep, I need to start new opportunities in NetSuite so that we build clean data from day one
- As a Support Team Member, I need clear go-live support options so that we address issues quickly

**Current State Process:**
**PROCESS**: Anticipated Go-Live Transition  
**TRIGGER**: Go-live date reached  
**STEPS**:
1. Team starts all new business in NetSuite → new opportunities, quotes, orders begin in NetSuite
2. Team continues existing Core projects → completes projects already in progress in Core
3. Team phases project migration where possible → moves projects to NetSuite when logical breakpoints occur
4. Dual systems run for ~6 months → gradual wind-down of Core usage
5. Core fully retired when all projects complete → END
**SYSTEMS INVOLVED**: NetSuite (new), Core (legacy during transition)  
**PAIN POINTS**: Learning curve during transition; "Kleenex may be required"; different transaction numbering to adjust to

**BRD Requirements:**

### 10. PROJECT NUMBERING & TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT

#### 10.1 How will project numbering and transaction management work?

**Answer:**

**Project Numbering Approach:**
- **Consistent project number/name across all transaction types**
- Different transaction numbers for Opportunity, Proposal, Sales Order, Purchase Order (NetSuite standard)
- Project number remains consistent throughout lifecycle

**Transaction Flow:**
Opportunity (OPP-####) → Proposal/Quote (Q-####) → Sales Order (SO-####) → Purchase Order (PO-####)
- Each transaction type has its own numbering sequence
- Project number/name ties them all together
- All stages visible and linked

**Search & Access Capabilities:**
- Global search by project number, customer name, phone number
- Recent transaction dialog box (last 10-15 items)
- Click path relearning required from Core

**User Adjustment Expected:**
- "One thing people get tripped up on, but then it's not a big deal"
- Current state: Memorized order numbers
- Team adjustment: "Kleenex may be required"
- Resolution: Project number consistency provides continuity

**User Stories:**
- As a Sales Rep, I need to find my projects by project number so that I can access all related transactions
- As a Project Coordinator, I need to see all transaction stages linked so that I understand the full project lifecycle

**Current State Process:**
**PROCESS**: Transaction Access in Core  
**TRIGGER**: User needs to find a project or order  
**STEPS**:
1. User recalls order number from memory → searches in Core
2. User accesses order directly → views information
**SYSTEMS INVOLVED**: Core ERP  
**PAIN POINTS**: Memorized numbers won't work the same way; need to search by project instead

**BRD Requirements:**
- [REQUIREMENT] Establish consistent project number/naming across Opportunity → Proposal → Sales Order → PO (ID: REQ-046, Type: Functional) - ALIGNS
- [REQUIREMENT] Enable global search by project, customer name, phone number (ID: REQ-047, Type: Functional) - ALIGNS
- [REQUIREMENT] Configure recent transaction dialog for quick access to last 10-15 items (ID: REQ-048, Type: Functional) - ALIGNS
- [PRIORITY] Must-Have
- [RISK] User frustration during adjustment period from Core numbering to NetSuite approach
- [ASSUMPTION] Users will adapt to new numbering after initial learning curve

**Stakeholder Impact:**
- **Primary Users**: All users accessing transactions (sales, operations, finance)
- **Impacted Parties**: Entire organization adjusting to new search methods

**Evidence:**
- "Project numbering convention to be established (opportunity, proposal, sales order prefixes)" - Decisions
- "Project number consistent across all transactions" - Transcript
- "Different numbers for Opportunity, Proposal, Sales Order, Purchase Order - Current state: Memorized order numbers - Team adjustment: 'Kleenex may be required'" - Concerns
- "Global search capabilities (by project, customer name, phone number) - Recent transaction dialog box (last 10-15 items)" - Features
- "One thing people get tripped up on, but then it's not a big deal" - Reassurance

**Confidence Rating**: 96% - Clear numbering approach with acknowledged adjustment period

**Outstanding Items:**
