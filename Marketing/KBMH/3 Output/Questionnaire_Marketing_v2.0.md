## Decision Log

### Phase 1 Scope Decisions
- **REQ-001**: Minimal email marketing implementation in Phase 1 (ALIGNS) - "the capability is fine, and it's great to know that we can do it. It'll probably get underutilized compared to other market… other dealers" - Matt; "We won't plan for much there [email marketing]" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone)

- **REQ-002**: Enable targeted segmentation by role, sector, and location (ADAPT) - "We want to be able to tailor those markets by location and by what their focus may be" - Speaker 2; "I need… to know how it works in terms of segmenting users and groups and the tagging" - Speaker 4 (Cornerstone)

- **REQ-003**: Manage opt-in/unsubscribe status natively in NetSuite (ALIGNS) - "NetSuite will manage that for you automatically" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone); "if they've unsubscribed and I need to tell them about a rate change, I can still send that, even if they've unsubscribed" - Speaker 2

- **REQ-004**: Support curated broker/PM lists for periodic value communications (ADAPT) - "if we did have a curated list of brokers and PM firms or CM firms, and, like, we did send out quarterly, oh, here's some market rates we're seeing, or something that we feel like would add value, and it was easier, we didn't have to recreate the wheel every time, I could see us using it" - Kimmy

- **REQ-005**: Showroom event tracking and invitations (ALIGNS) - "you'll have the availability to do the email marketing inside of NetSuite" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone); "we're probably doing something maybe twice a month at this point" - Jill Marsh

- **REQ-006**: Marketing visibility into leads/sectors for proactive content creation (ACCOMMODATE) - "if marketing had more insight into what some of those leads are and could see and track over time the sectors and how the market is changing, then it would be easier for that team to create proactively create targeted email material" - Speaker 4 (Cornerstone)

### Lead & Opportunity Management Decisions  
- **REQ-007**: Web form lead capture with routing (ALIGNS) - "We would keep the web forum. Because we have it today, and it serves a purpose, and it'd be weird to be a business without a web form" - Matt

- **REQ-008**: Lead progression to opportunity with stage tracking (ALIGNS) - "most of our business development team actually creates it as an opportunity, and there is a lead stage under opportunity" - Kimmy

- **REQ-009**: Opportunity stages matching current Zendesk workflow (ADAPT) - "LEAD RFP Awarded Programming Proposal Presented, on hold, order one, unqualified or closed loss" - Kimmy

- **REQ-010**: Restrict opportunity visibility to assigned team members only (ACCOMMODATE) - "people don't want other people to see their stuff... competition" - Jill Marsh; "we can restrict their opportunities to only the ones that they're on. It does that natively" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone); "Don't create a thread that shows everything that's ever happening in Zend… or in NextWeek" - Matt

### Influencer & Event Tracking Decisions
- **REQ-011**: Track influencers (brokers, A&D firms, PMs) with ROI attribution (ACCOMMODATE) - "it'd be so cool to see, like, the ROI of an investment on a relationship. like, I spent $6,000 on this person, and I got $3 million. Okay, great" - Speaker 4 (Cornerstone); "we invited this person at 9 campaigns, I've never done anything with it, why do I keep inviting them?" - Matt

- **REQ-012**: Event attendance tracking linked to opportunities (ADAPT) - "if there's opportunities that are created and they're assigned as an influencer and the opportunity, you would have visibility into that" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone)

- **REQ-013**: Expense tracking integration with influencer attribution (ACCOMMODATE) - "we do ask people on their expenses to list the attendees when they submit an expense, so if we can try Expensify or whatever we're using to pull that information to that… there's a matching contact in System, we could log all of them" - Matt

- **REQ-014**: Influencer contribution percentage with default even split (ACCOMMODATE) - "You should just default to an even, and then somebody would manipulate differently if they chose to do so" - Matt

### CRM & Pipeline Management Decisions
- **REQ-015**: Kanban board view for opportunity pipeline management (ALIGNS) - "I think it'd be a good tool for us to try and test out" - Matt

- **REQ-016**: Forecast reporting based on 70%+ probability only (ADAPT) - "we don't forecast anything below 70%. So whenever we say forecast, it's 70% or greater" - Kimmy

- **REQ-017**: Sales goals dashboard with progress bars by person and office (ACCOMMODATE) - "Yes. Yes. Okay, and we want it to be a… just a dashboard" - Matt; "I insisted on the progress bars last year" - Matt

- **REQ-018**: Volume and close date change alerts on dashboard (ACCOMMODATE) - "we'd love to be able to see a volume change, or if there was an order that was supposed to book in… it was going to order in January, and then we pushed it to February" - Jill Marsh

### Data & Reporting Decisions
- **REQ-019**: Import Zendesk historical data with tagging (ALIGNS) - "Export the entire [CSV]… import it and tag it" - Kip / Speaker 7 (Cornerstone)

- **REQ-020**: Eliminate company-wide activity feed to reduce internal competition (ACCOMMODATE) - "There is a company-wide feed, and it will show you every change that is made to every op chain" - Matt; "not having that activity thread visible, though, is for sure helpful" - Jill Marsh

- **REQ-021**: Duplicate detection at lead/opportunity creation (ALIGNS) - "if somebody fills it out similar, but they don't deny it, they just, they give you the option right then to merge it" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone)

### Email & Communication Decisions
- **REQ-022**: Replace MailChimp manual uploads with NetSuite communications (ADAPT) - "MailChimp gets really pissed off when you try to load in Excel, because they think you're going to spam a bunch of people, and then most of it bounces anyways" - Matt

- **REQ-023**: Outlook/Gmail integration for email tracking to opportunities (ALIGNS) - "attach this to, you know, this email to an opportunity, or start tracking this conversation" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone); "some of them have actually complained that it doesn't link right now, because they'd like to be able to track that activity within the system" - Matt

- **REQ-024**: Google Drive/SharePoint file integration to avoid storage limits (ACCOMMODATE) - "we're going to integrate with Google Drive, and it's just represented in NetSuite. It's not… it doesn't actually live in NetSuite" - Speaker 7 (Cornerstone); "then that's something we could definitely turn on, if it's just files that live within that trajectory to keep us out of the 100 [gigabytes]" - Matt

### RFP & Marketing Request Management Decisions
- **REQ-025**: RFP tracking with volume forecasting (ADAPT) - "we track what that projected volume is versus what the actual volume is, so that we can see, like, how many people are overestimating" - Speaker 4 (Cornerstone)

- **REQ-026**: Build marketing/RFP request forms in NetSuite tied to clients (ACCOMMODATE) - "Can we build an RFP request, or a marketing request, into NetSuite, Orion, and then also that be tied to the client... So, like, I can see every marketing request ever made for a client" - Matt; "we have the request engine, and it allows you to create any type of request form that you want inside of NetSuite" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone)

### GP & Financial Tracking Decisions
- **REQ-027**: Global GP target of 22% with customer-level overrides (ACCOMMODATE) - "we have a target GP goal, which is 22%" - Matt; "a global GP percentage, target GP percentage... But then a field on the customer record" - Speaker 3 (Cornerstone)

- **REQ-028**: GP percentage defaults from customer record to opportunity (ACCOMMODATE) - "everything defaults to whatever we set them as a customer. So, like, we know with Google, it's always 12.5%, but they can also go… so any new thing they create will always be at 12.5%" - Matt

- **REQ-029**: Visual GP warning when below company goal (ACCOMMODATE) - "when they override it, if it's less than what our company goal is, it puts their GP in red... at the order level" - Matt

- **REQ-030**: Margin variance tracking with reason codes (ACCOMMODATE) - "if there's a negative and a positive, they're going to combine and then create a new total... we try to get the PCs to code them the same, the pickups the same as the hits, so that they become less of a financial impact" - Matt; "we have codes that go with that variance... is it a design error? Is it a customer accommodation? Vendor issue? Shipping" - Matt

### 1. Current State Assessment

#### 1.1 Lead Generation & Capture

**Answer:**
Primary lead sources (in order of importance):
1. **Influencer-driven leads** (dominant source) - Relationships with brokers, A&D firms, project managers drive most opportunities
2. **RFPs through relationships** - Formal requests come through established influencer relationships
3. **Web form submissions** (minimal value) - Mostly cleaning quotes and one-off requests, occasional valuable existing client inquiries

**Current Process:**
- Web form leads route to Matt for qualification
- Most web form leads are low-value and deleted (cleaning quotes, one-off consumer requests)
- Influencer leads managed by business development GMs who own relationships
- RFPs trigger formal Asana requests to marketing team with volume projections

**Pain Points:**
- Manual qualification and routing
- No systematic tracking of influencer ROI
- Web form produces mostly noise
- Data entry inconsistency in Zendesk

**User Stories:**
- As Matt (Marketing lead), I need automated lead qualification so that I don't waste time on cleaning quote requests
- As a GM, I need to track which influencers are generating valuable opportunities so that I can focus relationship-building efforts effectively
- As a Marketing team member, I need visibility into lead sectors and trends so that I can create targeted content proactively

**Evidence:**
- "Goes web form, lead creation… I qualify… most of the time… cleaning quote… then I delete" - Matt
- "I did get one last week that was an existing client that just wrote cubicles. And I sent it to Chris, and it resulted in an order" - Matt
- "RFP will come in… relationship… formal project request through Asana to the marketing team" - Speaker 4 (Cornerstone)
- "Most of those are managed by our business development team... the general managers, like, their relationships. So they're the owners of all of that" - Kimmy

**Confidence Rating:** 95% - Multiple explicit statements with clear examples

**BRD Requirements:**
- [REQUIREMENT] Web form lead capture with auto-routing (ID: REQ-007, Type: Functional) [ALIGNS]
- [REQUIREMENT] Lead qualification workflow (ID: REQ-008, Type: Functional) [ALIGNS]
- [REQUIREMENT] Influencer relationship tracking with ROI metrics (ID: REQ-011, Type: Functional) [ACCOMMODATE]
- [CONSTRAINT] Low web form lead quality
- [PRIORITY] Must-Have: Lead capture; Should-Have: Influencer ROI tracking

#### 1.2 Current Tools & Platforms

**Answer:**
- **Zendesk**: Current CRM for opportunities and leads; retiring soon
- **MailChimp**: Email marketing (pay-as-go, used <6 times/year); manual list uploads problematic
- **Asana**: RFP and project request management; tracks volume projections vs actuals
- **Google Sheets**: Various tracking and reporting; RFP metrics; manual data compilation
- **Core**: Financial system; some customer data but not used for CRM
- **Paperless Post**: Event invitations for large events
- **Google Forms**: RSVP tracking when needed
- **Google Drive**: File storage and collaboration (preferred over other tools)

**Pain Points:**
- Multiple disconnected systems
- Manual data movement between systems
- MailChimp rejects Excel uploads (spam protection)
- No integrated view of customer interactions
- Heavy reliance on manual spreadsheet reporting

**Evidence:**
- "I think you guys are using MailChimp currently" - Speaker 3; "We buy credits when we need them. We don't have a monthly or annual subscription" - Matt
- "MailChimp gets really pissed off when you try to load in Excel, because they think you're going to spam a bunch of people, and then most of it bounces anyways" - Matt  
- "Business developer or account manager will put in a formal project request through Asana to the marketing team" - Speaker 4
- "We do everything in slides, so we'll create, like, an image, and then we'll just embed that into MailChimp" - Speaker 4

**Confidence Rating:** 92% - Explicit tool names and usage patterns described

**BRD Requirements:**
- [REQUIREMENT] Replace MailChimp with NetSuite email marketing (ID: REQ-022, Type: Functional) [ADAPT]
- [REQUIREMENT] Migrate Zendesk data to NetSuite (ID: REQ-019, Type: Non-Functional) [ALIGNS]

- [PRIORITY] Must-Have: Zendesk migration; Should-Have: Asana replacement

#### 1.3 Email Marketing Current State

**Answer:**
- Frequency: Less than 6 times per year
- Approach: Historically mass emails (quarterly newsletters, events); shifting to targeted approach
- Current limitations: One-size-fits-all messaging; no segmentation capability; manual list creation
- Strategy shift: Moving from mass to targeted campaigns by role, sector, location
- Event-based: Showroom events ~2x/month, usually selective invitation from personal emails vs. MailChimp

**Future Vision:**
- Curated broker/PM lists for quarterly market rate updates
- Sector-specific content based on market trends
- Location-specific messaging
- Role-based targeting

**Evidence:**
- "I would say less than 6 times a year, because we don't even have… We have a pay-as-we-go MailChimp" - Matt
- "We used to do a quarterly newsletter, internal and external. We used to do event... the information we got back from it was so little, so we've really refocused" - Matt
- "the GM strategic playlist last year has been all around targeted sectors, industries, and the people within them" - Matt
- "it is so rare that we're doing any sort of, like, email campaign, even for an event, because so much of what we do is relationship-based" - Speaker 4
- "if we did have a curated list of brokers and PM firms or CM firms, and, like, we did send out quarterly, oh, here's some market rates we're seeing... I could see us using it" - Kimmy

**Confidence Rating:** 93% - Clear description of current state and vision

- [PRIORITY] Nice-to-Have: Email marketing in Phase 1

#### 1.4 Lead Qualification Process

**Answer:**
Current process is informal and varies by person:
- Matt qualifies web form leads; mostly deletes (cleaning quotes, consumer requests)
- Existing client inquiries routed to appropriate GM or account manager
- BD team qualifies influencer-driven leads based on relationship context
- Variable data quality in Zendesk - some enter detailed info, others minimal
- Most opportunities created directly as "opportunity with lead stage" rather than separate lead record
- No standardized qualification criteria

**Progression:**
- Lead stage → RFP stage → Programming → Proposal Presented → Awarded/Closed Won or Closed Lost
- Probability assigned manually; not linked to stage in Zendesk

**Evidence:**
- "which comes to me, which then I qualify, and then I give it to one of the GMs, or I, if it's an existing client, give it to that person. But most of the time, it's people asking if they can give us a cleaning quote, which then I delete" - Matt
- "the amount of information that they decide to input on that lead in Zendesk varies widely. Like, some people will put activities or tasks or contacts in their lead in Zendesk, some people will not" - Kimmy
- "most of our business development team actually creates it as an opportunity, and there is a lead stage under opportunity" - Kimmy

**Confidence Rating:** 90% - Detailed description with examples

**BRD Requirements:**
- [REQUIREMENT] Lead to opportunity progression with stage tracking (ID: REQ-008, Type: Functional) [ALIGNS]

**Answer:**
Marketing team structure:
- Matt: Appears to be marketing/operations lead; handles web form leads, email communications
- Carlos & Jillian: Marketing-specific team members (mentioned as "marketing-specific")
- Marketing project manager: Schedules RFP kickoff calls
- Philippine team: Time tracking for RFP projects (6+ months into tracking)

Roles in process:
- Qualify incoming web form leads
- Respond to RFP requests from BD/sales team
- Create RFP materials and proposals
- Track RFP volume projections vs. actuals
- Time tracking by project for ROI analysis
- Create marketing content (use Google Slides for collaboration)

- "the marketing project manager schedules a kickoff call with the key stakeholders to review" - Speaker 4
- "I get another report from a team that we have in the Philippines, and I'm getting their time entry on each project" - Speaker 4

**Confidence Rating:** 85% - Roles described but not comprehensive org chart

**Stakeholder Impact:**

#### 1.6 Biggest Challenges with Lead Acquisition

**Answer:**
1. **Lack of segmentation** - Cannot target by role, sector, location; one-size-fits-all messaging
2. **Poor data quality** - Inconsistent Zendesk data entry; "poo in, poo out"
3. **No influencer ROI visibility** - Spending thousands on relationships with no measurable return
4. **Manual processes** - Spreadsheet reporting, manual email list uploads, disconnected systems
5. **Limited marketing visibility** - Marketing can't see lead trends to create proactive targeted content
6. **Internal competition issues** - Salespeople monitor activity feeds and compete for deals; limited information entry due to trust issues

**Pain Points by Stakeholder:**
- Marketing: Can't see sector trends; manual RFP tracking; no content targeting capability
- Sales/BD: Losing time to internal competition; no influencer ROI data; manual opportunity tracking
- Leadership: Can't measure relationship investment ROI; poor forecast accuracy tracking

**Evidence:**
- "right now we have a one-size-fits-all, so when we do send something out, it's the same package, no matter what your role is, or involvement with us... there's just really no way right now to target" - Speaker 2/4
- "if marketing had more insight into what some of those leads are and could see and track over time the sectors... then it would be easier for that team to create proactively create targeted email material" - Speaker 4
- "some of these people we've spent thousands of tens of thousands of dollars on, and they give us zero business" - Matt
- "we're able to create campaigns like you would in Salesforce and have targeted approach. We've just… the data entry part of it has never been clean enough to trust in" - Matt

**Confidence Rating:** 94% - Multiple explicit pain points with examples

**BRD Requirements:**
- [REQUIREMENT] Segmentation by role/sector/location (ID: REQ-002, Type: Functional) [ADAPT]
- [REQUIREMENT] Marketing visibility into leads/sectors (ID: REQ-006, Type: Functional) [ACCOMMODATE]
- [REQUIREMENT] Influencer ROI tracking (ID: REQ-011, Type: Functional) [ACCOMMODATE]
- [PRIORITY] Must-Have: Segmentation; Should-Have: ROI tracking

#### 1.7 Marketing Performance & ROI Tracking

**Answer:**
Current tracking is manual and limited:

**RFP Metrics** (manually tracked in spreadsheets by Jillian/marketing team):
- Projected volume vs. actual volume by salesperson
- Win rates by salesperson
- RFP volume generated by salesperson
- Time tracking by project (Philippines team - 6 months of data)
- Sector-based analysis (tech vs. healthcare vs. other)

**What's NOT tracked:**
- Influencer ROI (event spending vs. resulting opportunities)
- Email campaign effectiveness (limited usage means limited tracking)
- Event attendance to opportunity conversion
- Relationship investment to revenue attribution

**Reporting Challenges:**
- Manual compilation from multiple sources
- Lack of real-time visibility
- Can't correlate expense data to influencer relationships
- Takes months to gather enough data for trend analysis

**Evidence:**
- "we track what that projected volume is versus what the actual volume is, so that we can see, like, how many people are overestimating, what is this really" - Speaker 4
- "I get another report from a team that we have in the Philippines, and I'm getting their time entry on each project, so over time, I can see... here's the ROI that we're getting from their VIN" - Speaker 4
- "Before we even get to that stage, Jillian's doing a ton of data matrix and tracking at the RFP level, like what are individual salespeople's win rates based off the number of RFPs that they're coming in" - Matt
- "that's all being done by Jillian and her team putting that into spreadsheets and tracking that data" - Matt

**Confidence Rating:** 90% - Detailed description of manual tracking with clear gaps

**BRD Requirements:**
- [REQUIREMENT] RFP volume tracking and forecasting (ID: REQ-025, Type: Functional) [ADAPT]
- [REQUIREMENT] Influencer ROI reporting (ID: REQ-011, Type: Functional) [ACCOMMODATE]
- [REQUIREMENT] Win rate reporting by salesperson (ID: REQ-030+, Type: Functional) [ACCOMMODATE]
