## Implementation Approach Classifications

**ALIGNS**: The way the dealer is executing a business process in their current business system aligns with how they will do it in Orion. It might not be an exact one-to-one alignment, but it doesn't require any customizations for them to do what they are currently doing now in Orion.

**ADAPT**: They do need to modify their business process to use Orion. Adaptation is on a spectrum so it could be major or minor - but still no customization required.

**ACCOMMODATE**: WE will accommodate their business process by customization, personalization, new configuration - something we need to do to accommodate their needs.

**FUTURE**: Functionality to be evaluated or implemented in a future phase, not Phase 1.

## Customization Summary

**Solution Design Required (SolutionDesign? = Yes): 14 requirements**

### High Complexity Customizations:
1. **Multi-dimensional segmentation system** (REQ-M004, M005, M006, M007, M008) - Custom fields, taxonomy, validation rules, governance
2. **Marketing intelligence dashboard suite** (REQ-M019, M020, M021) - Custom dashboards, permissions, analytics
3. **RFP workflow and volume tracking** (REQ-M016, M017) - Custom workflow, fields, reporting
4. **Marketing team restricted pipeline visibility** (REQ-M015) - Complex permission matrix

### Medium Complexity Customizations:
5. **Google Drive integration** (REQ-M025) - Connector configuration, governance
6. **RFP request engine** (REQ-M017) - Form design, workflow routing
7. **Content library management** (REQ-M026) - Folder structure, permissions
8. **Philippines team integration** (REQ-M027) - Time tracking, resource visibility

## Critical Dependencies

**Blocking Configuration Phase:**
1. Contact role taxonomy definition (REQ-M006) → Blocks segmentation implementation
2. Sector/vertical classification list (REQ-M007) → Blocks industry field configuration
3. Territory assignment rules (REQ-M008) → Blocks geographic segmentation

**Blocking Go-Live:**
4. Data quality validation rules (REQ-M005) → Required for clean segmentation
5. Marketing pipeline visibility permissions (REQ-M015) → Security/access configuration
6. RFP workflow design (REQ-M017) → Replaces critical Asana process

**Post-Go-Live Evaluation:**
7. Event management adoption (REQ-M013, M014) → Evaluate 3-6 months post-launch
8. Customer satisfaction surveys (REQ-M022, M023) → Evaluate with Customer Service team

## Risk Analysis

### High Risk Requirements:
- **REQ-M004, M005, M006, M007**: Segmentation depends entirely on data quality and user adoption. If users don't classify contacts properly, entire segmentation strategy fails.
- **REQ-M015**: Marketing visibility into sales pipeline creates potential for internal competition/conflict. Careful permission design needed.
- **REQ-M020, M021**: Market intelligence dashboards require consistent opportunity data entry by sales team. Garbage in = garbage out.

### Medium Risk Requirements:
- **REQ-M002, M012**: Email marketing may be over-invested given minimal usage (<6/year). Could defer more setup to post-launch.
- **REQ-M016, M017**: RFP workflow replaces critical Asana process. Must be fully functional at go-live or maintain Asana parallel.
- **REQ-M003**: Marketing-as-RFP-coordination is non-traditional. Off-the-shelf training won't apply; custom training needed.

### Low Risk Requirements:
- **REQ-M013, M014**: Event management is explicitly low priority and deferrable. No risk if not implemented.
- **REQ-M024**: Web form integration standard functionality. Low lead quality expected but not system risk.

## Data Migration Considerations

**From MailChimp:**
- Email templates (if desired) - Low priority per team
- Historical campaign performance (optional)
- Subscription/opt-out status (if tracked) - Currently manual

**From Core/Zendesk:**
- Contact records (clean and classify during migration - CRITICAL)
- Basic segmentation data (if exists)
- Historical email preferences (if tracked)

**Data Cleansing Requirements (CRITICAL):**
Based on "poo in, poo out" comments, data migration must include:
1. Contact role classification project - Manual review and classification
2. Sector/industry assignment - Research and assign to all contacts
3. Territory assignment - Assign to appropriate GM territory
4. Duplicate detection and merge - Clean database before go-live
5. Opt-in status research - Determine subscription status for marketing contacts

**Estimated Effort**: Data classification could be significant manual effort depending on contact volume.

## Integration Requirements

**External Systems:**
1. **Website contact form** → NetSuite (web-to-lead) - Standard integration
2. **Google Drive** → NetSuite - Requires connector configuration (REQ-M025)
3. **Outlook/Gmail** → NetSuite - Email integration for activity tracking
4. **Philippines team time tracking system** → NetSuite (mentioned for RFP volume tracking)

**Internal NetSuite Integration:**
- Marketing module → CRM (opportunity visibility with restrictions)
- Marketing module → Project Management (RFP workflow)
- Marketing module → Reporting/Analytics (dashboards)

## Training Requirements

**Marketing Team:**
- Contact segmentation and list creation (CRITICAL)
- Email campaign creation (light training - minimal usage)
- RFP workflow and volume tracking (replaces Asana)
- Market intelligence dashboard usage
- Event management (if implemented)
- Survey creation (future phase)

**Sales/BD Team (Marketing Impact):**
- Early opportunity creation for marketing visibility
- Contact role classification (critical for segmentation)
- Sector assignment (critical for trend tracking)
- Data quality standards

**Admin (Jenny):**
- Lead qualification and routing
- Web form lead management
- Contact database maintenance and segmentation
- Duplicate detection and merge
- Data quality monitoring

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
1. **Data Quality**: >90% of contacts properly classified by role and sector
2. **Segmentation Usage**: Marketing team creates at least 3 saved searches/segments
3. **RFP Workflow**: 100% of RFPs routed through NetSuite (Asana retired)
4. **Market Intelligence**: Marketing team actively uses sector trend dashboard weekly
5. **Email Consolidation**: MailChimp retired; all campaigns through NetSuite

**6-Month Post-Launch Success Criteria:**
6. **Targeted Communications**: At least quarterly communications to segmented lists
7. **Volume Tracking**: Projected vs. actual volume tracked on all RFPs
8. **ROI Visibility**: Marketing team reports proactive content creation based on sector trends
9. **User Adoption**: Sales team consistently classifies contacts (>85% compliance)

**12-Month Evaluation Criteria:**
10. **Event Management**: Decision on event tracking adoption based on ROI
11. **Survey Implementation**: Decision on customer satisfaction survey deployment
12. **Campaign Frequency**: Increase from <6/year to quarterly targeted campaigns

## Notes and Recommendations

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Data quality is foundation** - Without clean, classified contact data, segmentation and market intelligence fail
2. **Taxonomy workshop is blocking** - Cannot configure until roles and sectors defined
3. **Change management focus** - Sales team must adopt contact classification discipline
4. **Marketing team training** - Non-traditional marketing role requires custom training approach
5. **Realistic expectations** - Don't over-invest in email marketing given minimal usage

### Implementation Recommendations:
1. **Phase 1 Focus**: Segmentation foundation, RFP workflow, market intelligence dashboards
2. **Phase 1 Defer**: Event management, surveys, advanced campaign automation
3. **Parallel Run**: Consider Asana parallel for 2-4 weeks during RFP workflow transition
4. **Data Migration**: Budget significant time for contact classification project
5. **Permission Design**: Careful design of marketing pipeline visibility to avoid sales conflict
