## Executive Summary

The Financial Management discovery process has been enhanced from v1.0 to v1.1 by incorporating a comprehensive follow-up discovery session framework. This update identifies 8 critical areas requiring deeper exploration before configuration can proceed, clarifies decision-making authority and timelines, maps all requirements to specific discovery sessions, and provides enhanced risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

**Key Finding**: All 38 requirements from v1.0 remain valid and unchanged. The v1.1 update adds strategic planning, decision gates, session dependencies, and enhanced change management considerations to ensure successful implementation.
